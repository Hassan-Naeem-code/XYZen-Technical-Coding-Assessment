# Weather Assistant App

## Overview
Weather Assistant is a sleek, modern mobile app that provides personalized weather updates and notifications.  
It uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) for live weather data and [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) for geocoding.  
The app features a user-friendly React Native interface and sends unique iOS notifications for interesting weather events not found in the default iPhone Weather app.
